# Code Review Guide

## The following is a list of conventions that members agreed on when making pull requests and reviewing code

1. For each feature, a member must create a feature branch and work on it before integrating with the master branch 
2. A member must not merge his/her own pull request with the master branch
3. Another person should review a member's pull request, add a comment and merge with the master branch
4. All team members have to review, comment and merge another team memberâ€™s pull request for every sprint. This means one person per review.
5. A pull Request must be small to allow for easy and quick review. This means that if even if the user story being worked on has several changes, it must be split into individual pull requests.
6. The developer must provide an explanation of what their change is and why they are making that change so that anyone can pick it up and review it.
7. Developers must ensure as much as possible that their pull requests are for atomic, non-breaking changes. The tests for each user story being merged should still pass after being merged with the master branch
8. A checklist must be provided for the unit tests conducted for each user story whose pull request is done
